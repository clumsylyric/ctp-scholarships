**NEC**

NEC scholarships (Presidential Distinction, Dean’s scholarship, etc.) are awarded to full-time students based on the student’s talent/merit (e.g., audition and application) and financial need. Merit is primarily determined through the audition process, while financial need is based on the FAFSA and/or additional financial information provided during the application process. 

INCOMING STUDENTS To be considered for this award, incoming students must complete the necessary Financial Aid application as part of their application. International students may be asked to supply additional financial information during the admission process.

From the Top Scholarships   
As part of NEC’s long-time partnership with the From the Top program, NEC offers funding to students who have performed on the program and have been admitted to NEC. From the Top alumni are then guaranteed NEC scholarship funds of at least $7,500 per academic year. This funding is part of the student’s overall scholarship from the Conservatory; there is not a separate fund name for From the Top scholars.
